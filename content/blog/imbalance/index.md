TL;DR - predictions from binary classification models should come from a probability threshold that is informed by the data, not by our coin flip heuristic. 

Class imbalance is a pervasive issue in machine learning classification models, so much so that it has rightly gained significant attention across the machine learning community.

Downsampling, upsampling, avoiding "accuracy" as a metric, SMOTE, syntehtic data, ... lots of other potential "solutions" to this problem.
